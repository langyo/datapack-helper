# datapack-helper
VSCode datapack-helper extension, providing basic template for datapack creation, json schema and autocompletion for command functions.

* Some data used are from PepijnMC's [Minecraft data](https://github.com/PepijnMC/Minecraft), with minor modification (removing the `minecraft:` namespace).
* JSON schema for advancements and loot tables are from Levertion's [minecraft-json-schemas](https://github.com/Levertion/minecraft-json-schemas).

## Usage
### Commands
```
datapack.initialize
```
Initialize a datapack, generate `.datapack` folter and files for tracking data, and `pack.mcmeta`.

```
datapack.read
```
Parse functions and advancements, prepare completion data and store them in `.datapack` folder.

Only need to use it at the first time to prepare those data, and those data would be updated when there are file changes
